### About 
This repo is built on the tutorial : LULC classification using Deep learning https://github.com/climatechange-ai-tutorials/lulc-classification presented in Climate Change AI Summer School. 

The tutorial is a large flow, which I have tried to break down in smaller notebooks, with more description of each of the steps, for a better understanding for those new to pytorch (like me, who is learning pytorch in the process of working out these tutorials)

### Goal   
The goal of these sets of notebooks is to build a Land Use Land Cover (LULC) model for EuroSAT data using a pretrained model (ResNet50). 

### EuroSAT:   

* Contains 27000 labeled geo-referenced images of Sentinel2 covering 13 spectral bands and 10 classes 

### ResNet50:     
* 

### Notebooks : 
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Results
